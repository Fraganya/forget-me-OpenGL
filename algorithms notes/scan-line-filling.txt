Scan Line Polygon filling
-> an algorithm used for solid color filling in polygons.


Steps:
1. Find the intersections of the scan line with all edges of the polygon
2. Sort the intersections by increasing x-coordinate thus from left to right
3. make pairs of the intersections and fill in color within all the pixels inside the pair.
