Flood-Fill(node,target-color,replacement-color)

1. if target-color is equal to replacement-color , return;
2. if the color of the node is not equal to target-color , return;
3. set the color of the node to replacement-color
4. perfom Flood-Fill(one step to south of node, target-color,replacement-color)
   perfom Flood-Fill(one step to north of node, target-color,replacement-color)
   perfom Flood-Fill(one step to west of node, target-color,replacement-color)
   perfom Flood-Fill(one step to east of node, target-color,replacement-color) 
5. return;


target-color = default color / the color you will find.
replacement-color = the color you want to change to

Methods of Implementation :
1. 4-connected pixel
2. 8-connected pixel

4-connected pixel:
-> you check 4 pixels adjacent to the current pixel, that is N(top),South(bottom),W(left),E(right)
-> so you fill the area with 4-connected pixels.

A problem with this algorithm in 4-connected pixels is that not all pixels are filled.
The solution is to use 8-connected pixels which fills adjacent diagnoal pixel positions such as:
(x+1,y+1)

========================
BASIC CONCEPT:
Flood fill algorithm is useful in cases where there no single color boundary for the polygon, i.e. the boundary has multiple colors.
In flood fill algorithm instead of filling color till you encounter a specific boundary color you just fill the pixels with default color.
It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color
Algorithm:
Flood-fill (node, target-color, replacement-color): 
1. If target-color is equal to replacement-color, return. 
2. If the color of node is not equal to target-color, return. 
3. Set the color of node to replacement-color. 
4. Perform Flood-fill (one step to the south of node, target-color, replacement-color).
     Perform Flood-fill (one step to the north of node, target-color, replacement-color).
     Perform Flood-fill (one step to the west of node, target-color, replacement-color).
     Perform Flood-fill (one step to the east of node, target-color, replacement-color). 
5. Return.
Methods of Implementation:
There are two methods in which the Flood-Fill Algorithm can be implemented:
4-connected pixel
8-connected pixel

4-connected pixel
In 4 connected pixel method you check 4 pixels adjacent to the current pixel, namely towards the North(top), South(bottom), west(left), East(right).
So you fill the area with 4-connected pixel method by following these steps
Step 1: First initialize the 4 values namely x, y, Fill-color & Default-color. Where x and y are co-ordinate positions of the initial interior pixel we start the flood fill algorithm & Fill-color is the color we want to fill and Default-color is the default color of the interior pixel
Step 2: If the color of node is not equal to default-color, return.
Step 3: Set the color of node to replacement-color.
Step 4: Set the color of node to the south of node to replacement-color. 
Step 5: Set the color of node to the north of node to replacement-color. 
Step 6: Set the color of node to the east of node to replacement-color. 
Step 7: Set the color of node to the west of node to replacement-color. 
Step 8: Exit.
